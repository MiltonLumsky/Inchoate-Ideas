out my vim command.  
  
I gained an IRC beta tester for my program yesterday--my first ever  
piece of open source collaboration!--I'll gain some more tomorrow,  
too. After that I'll finish with this, as it's taken up too much of my  
time already, time I should be spending on other tasks.  
  
If I could earn a living coding like this, I would.  But I'm too much  
of a zealot.  I have too many emotional requirments!  If I don't  
follow my philosophical requirements for what I code then I'm not  
happy.  Nevertheless, once, on a training day, I was happy coding on  
command.
