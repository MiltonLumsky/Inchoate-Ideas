I gained an IRC beta tester for my program yesterday--my first ever piece of  
open source collaboration!  I found a couple of bugs through his tests, and he  
said it was definitely useful: an enormous relief.  I'll gain some more testers  
tomorrow, too.    
  
If I could earn a living coding like this, I would.  But I'm too much of a  
zealot.  I have too many emotional requirments!  I'm rarely happy coding when I  
fail to follow my philosophical requirements, when I fail to abide by the  
tenets of Unix.  And in work, I'll rarely be able to follow such.   
  
Even so, this has not always been the case.    
  
Quite soon though I'll finish with this; it's taken up too much of my time  
already, time I should be spending on other tasks.
