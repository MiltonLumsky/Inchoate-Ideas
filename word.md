I gained an IRC beta tester for my program yesterday--my first ever  
piece of open source collaboration!  I found a couple of bugs through  
his tests, and he said it was definitely useful: an enormous relief.  
I'll gain some more testers tomorrow, too.  Quite soon though I'll  
finish with this; it's taken up too much of my time already, time I  
should be spending on other tasks.    
    
If I could earn a living coding like this, I would.  But I'm too much  
of a zealot.  I have too many emotional requirments!  If I don't  
follow my philosophical requirements for what I code then I'm not  
happy.  Nevertheless, once, on a training day, I was happy coding on  
command.    
    
here some more test which i am merely using to test out my vim script.  
well it's more a map, really.
